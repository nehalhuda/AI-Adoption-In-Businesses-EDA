## 🔍 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform a structured **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on AI adoption data to understand:

- 📈 Industry-level adoption rates  
- 🔗 Correlations between AI usage and key business metrics  
- 🏭 Which industries are leading or lagging in adoption  
- 📊 Trends, patterns, and insights visible through visual analytics  
- 🧹 Data quality, distribution, and preprocessing requirements

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** — data cleaning, transformation, grouping, merging  
- **Seaborn** — statistical visualizations  
- **Matplotlib** — custom charts and plots  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  

---

## 📊 What the Analysis Includes
- Data import and cleaning (missing values, standardization, type conversion)  
- Summary statistics and distribution analysis  
- Industry-by-industry breakdown of AI usage  
- Visualizations such as:
  - Bar charts  
  - Line plots  
  - Heatmaps  
  - Correlation visualizations
